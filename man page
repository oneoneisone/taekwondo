<h1>History of Taekwondo</h1>
<p>Taekwondo is a Korean martial art that is one of the worlds oldest, reaching back over 2,000 years. It is called 'Taekwondo' because of it's apt description- tae (foot) kwon (hand) and do (art).</p>
<p> When some masters travelled to the USA in the 1950's, the art was spread further. It appeared as a demonstration game in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Game, and became a fullfledged game in the 2000's games.</p>
